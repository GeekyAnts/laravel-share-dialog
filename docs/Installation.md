## **Prerequisites**

If you haveÂ [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)Â andÂ [Bouncer](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)Â pre-installed, you can move on to theÂ [Installation](#installation)Â section.

### 1) **Tailwind**

Install Tailwind as shown below:

```jsx
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

Next, generate your tailwind.config.js file:

```jsx
npx tailwindcss init
```

Add the following code to your tailwind.config.js file:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    "./resources/**/*.blade.php",
    "./resources/**/*.js",
    "./resources/**/*.vue",
  ],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### 2) **Bouncer**

Install Bouncer using composer:

```jsx
composer require silber/bouncer v1.0.0-rc.10
```

Add Bouncer's trait to your user model:

```jsx
use Silber\Bouncer\Database\HasRolesAndAbilities;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasRolesAndAbilities;
}
```

Run this command to publish the Bouncer's migrations to your app's migrations directory:

```jsx
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="bouncer.migrations"
```

## **Installation**

1. Install the share-dialog package using composer:

   ```jsx
   composer require geekyants/share-dialog
   ```

2. Run this command to move the share-dialog config file to your project's config folder:

   ```jsx
   php artisan vendor:publish  --tag="config"
   ```

3. Scaffold the vue components present in the share-dialog package into your project:

   ```jsx
   php artisan ui share-dialog
   ```

   AÂ share-dialogÂ folder containing Vue.js components will be created in your resources directory. You can now easily customise your share-dialog's Vuejs components ðŸš€

4. Execute this command to migrate Bouncer migrations and the new_users_share_dialog table present in the package:

   ```jsx
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. To compile and minify the JavaScript files generated by share-dialog, add this to your webpack.mix.js file:

   ```jsx
   .js("resources/js/share-dialog.js", "public/js")
   .vue()
   ```

   Note: If your css is not compiled in yourÂ app.css file,Â you can change it inÂ the share-dialog.blade.phpÂ file.

6. Install the dependencies:

   ```jsx
   composer update
   npm install
   ```

7. Finally, build your assets as shown below:

   ```jsx
   npm run dev
   ```
