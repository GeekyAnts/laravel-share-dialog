## Introduction

**ShareDialog** is a composer package for Laravel projects which allows other users to read or write your project's entities.

It helps you manage roles and permissions in an app by using Eloquent Models. You can assign read or write permissions to a user and remove permissions as required.

## Motivation

It becomes very time consuming to add share functionality in your laravel projects and therefore the development process gets disturbed. <br/>
This package aims to solve the problem and enables you to share your projects' entities with other users with minimal effort.

## Philosophy

This package makes use of [InertiaJs](https://inertiajs.com/) for the data flow between backend and frontend without writing any API's and [Bouncer](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer) to assign abilites and permissions to other users.
