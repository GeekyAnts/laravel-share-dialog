**When do I use Sharedo?**

If you want to share your project's entities with other users, then this package is for you. Users can be assigned **read/write** access or can even be removed from accessing your project's entities.

**When should I not use Sharedo?**

Sharedo was specifically built for projects where entities have a relation with the users. If your project's entities are independent of the users, then this package is not for you.

**How do you ensure the security?**

Security is ensured by the following:

- Users can apply restrictions through authorisation
- Only specific entities can be made shareable via middleware
